    // this plugin only needs to generate the service worker. `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` silently
    // swaps in a new service worker on the next load rather than making the portal show a stale
    // cached build after a deploy (a manual "update available" prompt is unnecessary complexity
    // for this app's release cadence). App shell (JS/CSS/HTML/icons) is precached so the portal
    // still loads offline; `/api/` calls are explicitly NOT precached or matched by any runtime
    // rule below, since a cached loan balance or status silently going stale is worse than the
    // existing OfflineBanner honestly telling the borrower they're offline - matches CLAUDE.md's
    // "cached recently viewed data... graceful retry... clear offline indicators", not "serve
    // stale financial data as if it were live".
