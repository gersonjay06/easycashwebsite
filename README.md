# EasyCash Digital Lending Platform

**Enterprise Loan Management System for Easycash Lending Company Inc.**

A ground-up rebuild of the company's lending operations — replacing Excel/Google Sheets
workflows, a legacy SDevTech platform, and a MongoDB-backed system — with a single,
configurable, auditable, and versioned Loan Management System designed for long-term
production use.

---

## Status

**Two apps, one backend, both live:**

| App | Audience | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Easycash LMS** (`app/lmsfrontend`) | Internal staff (MIS, Loan Operation Management, CRM, Finance, Accounting, Collection) | 🟢 Live, wired to real production data — preview build |
| **Easycash Portal** (`app/portalfrontend`) | Borrowers — apply for a loan, track status, view payment history, chat with their loan officer | 🟢 Live at `easycashportal.ph` |

Both are served by the same backend (`app/easycashbackend`). Real production data has been
migrated from the legacy MongoDB/SDevTech system: thousands of borrowers, loan products, loan
accounts, and hundreds of thousands of transactions.

The platform ships frequent, dated releases. The authoritative, plain-language version history
for both apps — current version numbers, what shipped and when — lives in
[`app/lmsfrontend/src/lib/lmsVersion.ts`](app/lmsfrontend/src/lib/lmsVersion.ts) and is surfaced
on the LMS's own About page. Day-to-day engineering narrative (what was done, why, bugs found and
fixed) is recorded per session in [`docs/session-logs/`](docs/session-logs/) and
[`docs/`](docs/) (`SESSION_LOG_*.md`).

## Why this project exists

Easycash Lending Company Inc. previously ran on a patchwork of Excel, Google Sheets, a legacy
SDevTech lending application, and a MongoDB-backed transaction ledger. This platform replaces
that patchwork with one system, while treating the legacy data as authoritative evidence — every
non-trivial financial rule implemented here is backed by verified legacy behavior or an explicit,
confirmed business decision, not assumption.

### Core principles

- **No invented financial logic.** If a rule isn't confirmed by legacy evidence or an explicit
  business decision, it is stored as data, never guessed.
- **Configurable, versioned loan products.** Interest methods, fees, penalties, and payment
  allocation rules are configurable per product version; every approved loan keeps an immutable
  snapshot of the rules it was approved under.
- **Financial correctness over convenience.** Full audit trails, fail-closed logging on financial
  state changes, and a documented paper trail for every non-obvious decision.

## Technology stack

**Frontend** — React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, React Hook Form, Zod, TanStack Query
**Backend** — Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Clean Architecture (domain / application /
infrastructure / interface layers)
**Database** — PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
**Auth** — JWT with refresh tokens, RBAC
**Deployment** — Docker, Docker Compose, self-hosted (office server / mini PC) with a Cloudflare
Tunnel for public access; portable to VPS/cloud
**Testing** — Vitest (unit + integration)

## Business goals

- Replace Excel, Google Sheets, and the legacy SDevTech platform with one system
- Preserve every validated business rule from production — never silently change behavior
- Support 10,000+ borrowers, 100,000+ loans, and millions of payments
- Minimize infrastructure cost — self-hosted first, open-source where possible
- Give borrowers a self-service portal alongside the internal staff LMS
- Keep documentation and financial-rule specifications continuously in sync with the code
